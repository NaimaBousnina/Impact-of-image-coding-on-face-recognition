This sub-repository  contains some of the image codecs adopted by IT to study the impact of image
coding on the overall face verification performance. These image codecs are classified into two main classes, notably:

##### 1. Conventional image codecs
- JPEG standard [[W. B. Pennebaker, et al., “JPEG: Still Image Data Compression
Standard,” Springer, 1993rd edition, 1993.](https://www.amazon.com/JPEG-Compression-Standard-Multimedia-Standards/dp/0442012721)].
- JPEG 2000 standard [[D. Taubman, et al., “JPEG2000: Standard for Interactive Imaging,” Proc. IEEE, vol. 90, pp. 1336 -1357, November 2002.](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1037564)].
- JPEG XL standard [[J. Alakuijala, et al., “JPEG XL Next-generation Image Compression Architecture and Coding Tools,” Proc. SPIE 11137, Appl. Digit. Image Process. XLII, San Diego, California, United States, September 2019.](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/JPEG-XL-next-generation-image-compression-and-tools-Alakuijala-Asseldonk/81dd9345797739a3499b272a5301ec1dd297ee33)].

##### 2. AI-based image codecs
- Balle2018 codec [[J. Ballé, et al., “Variational Image Compression with a Scale Hyperprior,” 6th Int. Conf. Learn. represent., Vancouver, BC, Canada, May 2018.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.01436.pdf)].
- Cheng2020 codec [[Z. Cheng, et al., “Learned Image Compression with Discretized Gaussian Mixture Likelihoods and Attention Modules,” IEEE/CVF Conf. Comput. Vis. Pattern Recog., Online, June 2020.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.01568.pdf)].
- Hific codec [[F. Mentzer, et al., “High-Fidelity Generative Image Compression,” Proc. Int. Conf. Neural Inf. Process. Syst., Online, December 2020.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.09965.pdf)].
